Some interesting things here.
- Separate the wire format from the abstract protocol and the api
- Model much of the api as essentially a set of tables that one can do queries on, where the table's state has a potential visual side effect, and where the db itself has some 'distributed db' considerations
- Double down on the 'extension+discovery' features, move everything from the base specification to 'extension number 1'
- 'how IPC works' has a bunch of implications, and doing everything 'actually async' needs to be designed in at quite a deeper level so that you can get things like 'higher order locks' etc to avoid races
