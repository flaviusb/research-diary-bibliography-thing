# research-diary-bibliography-thing
Cites, prior art, bibliography, notes on papers etc etc for my personal research project

Contains:
- `mk-reading.sh`: a script that creates a list of all the files you currently have open in evince
- `reading.sh`: a script to take one of those lists and open all the files up in evince
- `papers`: a folder with sorted, named papers in it
- `lists`: a folder with lists of sets of related papers/books I'm reading, with comments to note down the topics and my thoughts

## Notes to myself

Use `pdfgrep` to search through my downloaded papers folder with keywords, then rename the interesting pdfs to actually have the actual name and move it to `papers`.
